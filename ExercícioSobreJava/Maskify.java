//Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. 
//However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.
//Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.
